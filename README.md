#Plant Phenotyping / Growth Analysis 

This project focuses on analyzing plant growth under different environmental or treatment conditions using data-driven techniques. The goal is to quantify various plant traits—such as height, stem diameter, leaf count, and leaf area—over time to assess growth performance and treatment effects.

By designing a structured database (using SQL) to store experimental data and applying analytical techniques (using Excel or Python) to calculate growth rates, trends, and treatment comparisons, the project enables efficient phenotyping and data interpretation.

The outcomes help identify which treatments promote optimal growth and how different environmental factors influence plant development, aiding precision agriculture and crop improvement research.
